The Gaming Room was a company that wanted to contract out the development of a relatively simple game to be distributedfrom a web-based service.

If I had to say I did anything particularly well it would probably be my consideration of the potential user experience. For example noting that, in theory, a leaderboard of some kind would likely be a relatively easy but significant benefit to that user experience.

For me, the most helpful part about working through a design document was simply the benefit of having a template. I suffer heavily from staring blankly at a blank document and trying to think of how I should begin any given assignment, so being given what is essentially a list to fill in greatly benefitted my efficiency.

If I could revise any of my previous work, I would probably focus on changing the way I word sentences and explain ideas. I have tried pretty much since I began writing as a child to fix the way I manage to ramble on about some tangent vaguely related to the subject simply because I like explaining things, as I feel it enhances my own understanding. However, I am also old enough at this point that I feel it is almost stylistic, and would lose a part of feeling like I wrote it without that factor.

I feel like I addressed a user's needs through pretty much everything within the project. Memory and storage effects the user experience, in this case, by making sure that each user in a game is served the same image at the same time, and that the game remains responsive and quick-feeling throughout.

I did most of my design work for the project by essentially building on intuition and thinking of how ideas that came from that would be likely to play out. For example, in my mention of social features in the game, intuitively, social features seem like a fairly obvious thing to add to the game. However, social features, like a friends list or a messaging system, would be essentially meaningless without other structures and features surrounding them, like matchmaking of some kind, so that users will actually be in some kind of contact with users they do not already know beforehand. In this case, intuitively, social features are a good thing to add, but applying logic and experience to the situation, they would be meaningless on their own.



DriverPass was a client that wanted a system that would allow users to take practice exams and schedule appointments to practice driving with an instructor in order to reduce the failure rate of first time driver's license test-takers. If I had to say I did something particularly well, it would probably be understanding the sequence of events that are likely to play out when a user tried to use the system. If I were to improve one thing, it would probably be the UML class diagram, though I'm not entirely sure how I would imrpove it; otherwise, I'd have probably done it better in the first place. I interpeted needs and implemented them by considering things like the user needing to be able to make an account, and administrators needing to have control over those accounts afterward. It's important to consider these needs for fairly obvious reasons; a system or program or any tool that doesn't fulfill any sort of need isn't really doing anything but existing. I think my main approach to designing was essentially just considering what it would be like to try and access the system, and going from there. For example, if I were a potential student trying to access the system, I'd think about the process of creating an account, then logging into it, then taking practice exams and scheduling lessons, but if I were thinking about it from an administrator's perspective, I'd think about things like the control over the other accounts, and access to things like diagnostics and metrics.
